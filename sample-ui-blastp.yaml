parameters :
    input_one_sequence:
        ui-name : |
            Query Protein Sequence (optional)
        short-hint : |
            Must enter either a query protein sequence or an input query object. This is a single protein (amino acid) sequence to use for the search. The sequence entered here will be saved as a Query Object and must be named below.
        placeholder : |
            Optionally enter PROTEIN sequence...
    input_one_ref:
        ui-name : |
            Input Query Object (optional)
        short-hint : |
            Must enter either a query protein sequence or an input query object. This is a data object with a single protein (amino acid) sequence to use as query. Data objects must be a SequenceSet with only one sequence.
        placeholder : |
            ...or select PROTEIN Query Object
    input_many_refs:
        ui-name : |
            Search Targets
        short-hint : |
            The KBase data objects with proteins to be searched. Objects may be FeatureSet, Genome, GenomeSet, SpeciesTree, or Annotated Metagenome Assembly.
    genome_disp_name_config :
        ui-name : |
            Display genome as
        short-hint : |
            Use the object name, object version, and/or scientific name of the Genome in the function profile report
    output_filtered_name:
        ui-name : |
            Output Object
        short-hint : |
            The name of the FeatureSet object containing the BLAST hits to the supplied query.
    ident_thresh:
        ui-name : |
            Sequence Identity Threshold (%)
        short-hint : |
            The minimum percent identity threshold for hits (1-100).
    e_value:
        ui-name : |
            E-value Threshold
        short-hint : |
            The maximum e-value threshold for hits. The default is 0.001, but the number could also be written in exponential notation (e.g., 1E-3). All outputs will ignore hits with e-values greater than the e-value threshold.
    bitscore:
        ui-name : |
            Bit Score Threshold
        short-hint : |
            The minimum bit score threshold for hits.
    overlap_fraction:
        ui-name : |
            Alignment Overlap Threshold (%)
        short-hint : |
            The minimum alignment covereage threshold for hits (1-100). Labeled as ALN_LEN in the output.
    maxaccepts:
        ui-name : |
            Max Accepts
        short-hint : |
            Hard limit for the maximum number of hits in the result (default is 1000).
    write_off_code_prot_seq:
        ui-name : |
            Allow Mistranslation
        short-hint : |
            Write protein translation for target even if wrong genetic code (e.g. internal TER)
    output_extra_format:
        ui-name : |
            Extra Text Output Format
        short-hint : |
            Specify the format for an additional output file. Tab-delimited output is always generated as a default. This option is for one additional file. These options are described in the <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279684/”>NCBI BLAST</a> documentation.
description : |
  <p>This method performs a protein-protein (protein sequence alignment) BLASTp Search using NCBI's BLAST+ (version 2.11.0).</p>
  <p>BLASTp is a protein sequence search against a protein sequence database. The KBase implementation is restricted to searches of protein-coding genes in a Genome object, the Genome members of a GenomeSet or SpeciesTree, the genes in an Annotated Metagenome Assembly, or the features in a FeatureSet. The results of the search are displayed as a table, saved to a downloadable text file, and saved as a KBase FeatureSet object for later use.</p>
